## Mathematical modelling and simulation of mass-spring-damper system

Go through the "Experiment_4" PDF file attached for the problem statement.

If you refer exp4.m file you will see I have used "sim" function to read e4.slx file. I have used this function because if you want to publish a single report with and also need to include the SIMULNK file the you can use that function. For using sim function you have to keep one thing in mind that all the files must be in the same folder.
